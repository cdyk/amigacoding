# Christopher goofing around with Amiga assembly

I learned to program using assembly on the Amiga in the early 90's and did some demoscene stuff for some years.

I recently looked through some of my old sources and got a bit inspired. So I installed the vasm cross-assembler, mounted the output dir on WinUAE emulating an A500 and started to goof around again with Amiga assembly.

This repo contains the results. Currently that amounts to:
- Drop into supervisor mode and set up copperlist etc.
- A small 6x5 scroller.
- Blitter line draw, with clipping.
- 3D transforms.
